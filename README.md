# Olga-s-Store-
This project is a part of my Master Studies' Web Programming course. Online store is being done using Bootstrap, Lumen, REST, Angular.js, CSS, HTML, MySQL, etc. 
Main idea of the project is to be an online store which sells souvenirs and old money from Belgrade, Serbia.

The front end of the project is being done using:
  -Angular.js
  -HTML
  -CSS 
  -Bootstrap
  -JavaScript
  -JQuery
The back end of the project is being done using:
  -PHP

  -REST

Expectations of the users are to see the list of products, which is allowed by going through a catalogue  of products where they can see
prices by piece of each product, as well as short description. The buyers are users who are registered. 
The users are able to add items to the basket and, when they find it convenient, 
to purchase products chosen or to empty their basket in any moment. Each user in order to purchase products has to be registered, 
because his personal data (such as address where the products should be sent to) has to be known prior to the purchase. 
Also, user can be registered despite the fact he never orders anything, because during the registration we require only name, 
e-mail address and password, but if he wants to order any of the products it is obligatory that he provides some personal 
information(such as real name and address).
